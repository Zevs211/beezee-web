# UX for Client role

## A client is someone who hire vendor(-s) to implement a project

### A client may be:
- A User
- A Company

### A client may want:
- To make projects done (- and receive them if not online):
  - It needs to be created
    - From scratch using stepped constructor
    - By uploading project files (should generate a project from them)
    - By contacting a vendor company (BUT VENDOR COMPANY CANNOT CREATE PROJECTS!)

- To form a project:
  - from scratch
  - by uploading some project files which will generate some parts of a project
  - by contacting an agency
    (which will hire vendors on a platform or will make a project using their own resources)
- To search for / compare with other projects
