# Structure of web application

- Prelogin pages from targeted marketing links
  - For Vendors (2 variants)
  - For clients (3 variants)
- Registration page (which will partially have info for new user)
  And will be really small and easy to pass through
- Profile page with settings and resume, skills and other info
- Projects list page with filters, sortings and so on
- Project creation page
- Project stages/workflows page.
  Basically update/edit page with other functionality split into many parts for clients and vendors to work on project
- Vendors page (for clients mostly)
